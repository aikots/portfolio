  "about": "I’m Katerina Tsioutsia, a designer and developer based in Sweden. I’m currently studying an MSc in Interactive Media Technology, where I explore the intersection of design, tech, and storytelling.\n\nFrom building spaces to building games, I bring a holistic, hands-on approach to problem-solving. I geek out over sleek interfaces, atmospheric 3D worlds, and, yes—Scandinavian chairs.\n\nLet’s create something bold, beautiful, and maybe a little unexpected.",
